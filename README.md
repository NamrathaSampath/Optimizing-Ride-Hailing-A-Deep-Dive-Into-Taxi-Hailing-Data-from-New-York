**Optimizing Ride-Hailing : A Deep Dive Into Taxi Hailing Data from New York**

The taxi service industry has been around for more than 100 years, helping thousands of people commute daily. Traditional taxis in New York currently serve around 600,000 rides every day covering most of the area of the City. With widespread network reach and efficient services, NYC taxis are one of the most efficient and developed roadside transportation services in New York. On the other side, Uber and Lyft are new gen-ride-hailing services that have picked up substantial growth and popularity among users in the past few years all across the globe. The goal of the project is to compare these applications with the traditional yellow taxis to get an overview of the functioning of these services. This project aims to utilize the vast amount of data that is available, perform analysis on that data, and infer meaningful insights from it which can be used to improve the overall performance of these individual platforms. The study also aims to provide an Interface for users which could be accessible by their mobile phones, to compare all the options that are available at that particular time and then choose the best among them based on their needs and specific requirements.
